# PizzaStore - Minimal API

## Introduction
Welcome to the PizzaStore API project! This project is designed to demonstrate the power and simplicity of building web APIs with ASP.NET Core and .NET 8. The goal is to create a prototype API that can display data efficiently, serving as a conversation starter and a proof of concept for potential use within our company.

## Scenario
You've built an API that handles create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on a table of data. You plan to build a front-end 
application that uses that API. You want to store the data in a database so that you can use the data in your front-end application.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the fundamentals of Minimal APIs in ASP.NET Core.
- Learn to implement various route constructs for data operations.
- Integrate Swagger for API documentation and testing.
- Implement CRUD operations on a data model.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of C# and .NET programming.
- Familiarity with web API concepts.
- .NET 8 SDK and ASP.NET Core runtime installed.
-  SQLite database

## Features
- **Data Display**: Retrieve and display pizza menu items.
- **Data Management**: Add, update, and delete pizza menu items.
- **Swagger Integration**: Document the API endpoints for easy testing and accessibility.
- **CRUD Operations**: Implement create, read, update, and delete operations on the data model.
- **migration to SQLite database from in-memory database**
## Future Enhancements
As the API evolves, we plan to add more features such as authentication, advanced data filtering, and performance optimizations.
