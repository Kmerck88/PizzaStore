# PizzaStore - Minimal API

## Introduction
Welcome to the PizzaStore API project! This project is designed to demonstrate the power and simplicity of building web APIs with ASP.NET Core and .NET 8. The goal is to create a prototype API that can display data efficiently, serving as a conversation starter and a proof of concept for potential use within our company.

## Scenario
As developers, we often need to quickly prototype and iterate on new technologies to evaluate their fit for our needs. The Minimal API approach in ASP.NET Core allows us to do just that, enabling us to build APIs with minimal setup and code.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the fundamentals of Minimal APIs in ASP.NET Core.
- Learn to implement various route constructs for data operations.
- Integrate Swagger for API documentation and testing.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of C# and .NET programming.
- Familiarity with web API concepts.
- .NET 8 SDK and ASP.NET Core runtime installed.

## Features
- **Data Display**: Retrieve and display pizza menu items.
- **Data Management**: Add, update, and delete pizza menu items.
- **Swagger Integration**: Document the API endpoints for easy testing and accessibility.

## Future Enhancements
As the API evolves, we plan to add more features such as authentication, advanced data filtering, and performance optimizations.
